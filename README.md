# Hello-World
My First GitHub Repository
Hello Everyone

I am making this github account to allow myself to start the hopefully not long process of progamming my first mobile application. I hope to get it coded, de-bugged and submitted to the App store and the Play store before april of next year. Who, knows maybe I can get something going before the end of this year.
